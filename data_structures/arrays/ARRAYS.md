### When we say Array, what do we mean?

In layman's terms, an array is like a row of storage boxes, all lined up next to each other. Each box can hold a piece of information or an item, and these boxes are numbered in order, starting from the first box. You can easily access any box by referring to its number.

For example, imagine you have a row of boxes to store numbers: [3, 7, 1, 9, 4]. This is like an array of numbers. The first box (box number 1) contains the number 3, the second box (box number 2) contains 7, and so on. You can quickly find or change the number in any specific box by mentioning its number, making it easy to organize and work with lots of data.

- _Using an array means that all your tasks or pieces of information are stored in a sequence, right next to each other, in computer memory._

### Definition of an Array:

An array is a data structure in computer science that consists of a collection of elements or values, each identified by an index or a key. These elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient and direct access based on their position within the array. Arrays are typically used to store and manage multiple pieces of data of the same data type, organized in a linear or sequential fashion.
