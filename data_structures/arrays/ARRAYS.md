      ### When we say Array, what do we mean? In layman's terms, an array is
      like a row of storage boxes, all lined up next to each other. Each box can
      hold a piece of information or an item, and these boxes are numbered in
      order, starting from the first box. You can easily access any box by
      referring to its number. For example, imagine you have a row of boxes to
      store numbers: [3, 7, 1, 9, 4]. This is like an array of numbers. The
      first box (box number 1) contains the number 3, the second box (box number
      2) contains 7, and so on. You can quickly find or change the number in any
      specific box by mentioning its number, making it easy to organize and work
      with lots of data. - _Using an array means that all your tasks or pieces
      of information are stored in a sequence, right next to each other, in
      computer memory._ ### Definition of an Array: An array is a data structure
      in computer science that consists of a collection of elements or values,
      each identified by an index or a key. These elements are stored in
      contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient and direct access
      based on their position within the array. Arrays are typically used to
      store and manage multiple pieces of data of the same data type, organized
      in a linear or sequential fashion.
