# Selection Sort Notes

- **Algorithm Overview:**

  - Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part at the beginning of the list and the unsorted part at the end of the list. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.
  - The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.
  - This process is repeated until the unsorted part becomes empty and the entire list is sorted.

- **Function Parameters:**

  - Selection Sort typically operates directly on the list to be sorted, without needing additional parameters.

- **Performance:**

  - The time complexity in Big O notation is O(nÂ²), where 'n' is the number of elements in the list.
  - This makes it less efficient on large lists compared to more advanced sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort.

- **Conditions for Use:**
  - Selection Sort is a good choice for small lists or when simplicity is more desirable than efficiency.

### Implementation Steps:

- Begin with the first element of the list.
- Find the smallest (or largest) element in the list and swap it with the first element.
- Move to the next element and repeat the process with the remaining unsorted part of the list.
- Continue this process until the entire list is sorted.

- **Important Note:**

  - Selection Sort does not adapt to the initial order of elements, which means its runtime is always quadratic, regardless of the initial order of the list.

- **Real-Life Implementations:**

  - **Simple Ordering Tasks:** Like organizing a hand of playing cards where you repeatedly pick the lowest card to sort.

  - **Small Datasets:** Ideal for scenarios where the dataset is small and easy to manage, like sorting a small list of items in a to-do list application.

  - **Educational Purposes:** Often used as an introductory algorithm in computer science courses to teach the fundamentals of sorting.
